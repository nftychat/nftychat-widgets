# What are widgets?

Widgets are interfaces for other applications and smart contracts that highlight basic functionality. For example, the twitter widget is a basic feed of a few folks on twitter that a given community can follow. Another example is a widget that shows recent proposals on snapshot.org:

The interactivity is limited. Widgets display critical information or can perform the most common action of the full blown app.
